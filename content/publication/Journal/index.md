summary: This paper is an enhanced version of our previous method UWAT-GAN. It can be used to turning UWF scanning laser ophthalmoscopy(UWF-SLO) to the UWF fluorescein angiography(UWF-FA) and display the tiny vascular lesion areas. And it could be trained on a little misalignment paired UWF-SLO and UWF-FA.
