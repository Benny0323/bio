abstract: Fundus photography, in combination with the ultra-wide-angle fundus (UWF) techniques, becomes an indispensable diagnostic tool in clinical settings by offering a more comprehensive view of the retina. Nonetheless, UWF fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA) necessitates the
administration of a fluorescent dye via injection into the patientâ€™s hand or elbow unlike UWF scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (UWF-SLO). To mitigate potential adverse effects associated with injections, researchers have proposed the development of cross-modality medical image generation
algorithms capable of converting UWF-SLO images into their UWF-FA counterparts. Current image generation techniques applied to fundus photography encounter difficulties in producing high-resolution retinal images, particularly in capturing minute vascular lesions. To address these
issues, we introduce a novel conditional generative adversarial network (UWAFA-GAN) to synthesize UWF-FA from UWF-SLO. This approach employs multi-scale generators and an attention transmit module to efficiently extract both global structures and local lesions. Additionally, to counteract the image blurriness issue that arises from training with misaligned data, a registration module is integrated within this framework. Our method performs non-trivially on inception scores and details generation. Clinical user studies further indicate that the UWF-FA images generated by UWAFA-GAN are clinically comparable to authentic images in terms of diagnostic reliability. Empirical evaluations on our proprietary UWF image datasets elucidate that UWAFA-GAN outperforms extant methodologies.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper is an enhanced version of our previous method UWAT-GAN. It can be used to turning UWF scanning laser ophthalmoscopy(UWF-SLO) to the UWF fluorescein angiography(UWF-FA) and display the tiny vascular lesion areas. And it could be trained on a little misalignment paired UWF-SLO and UWF-FA.
