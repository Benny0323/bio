I am a fourth-year undergraduate student studying computer science and technology at [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://www.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm) where I am advised by [Prof. Ruiquan Ge](https://faculty.hdu.edu.cn/jsjxy/grq/main.htm) and [Prof. Changmiao Wang](https://www.sribd.cn/teacher/505). And I plan to pursue my master's degree at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn) advised by [Prof. Yikun Zhang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/yikun/main.htm).

I have a broad interest in deep learning models, with a primary focus on **medical image analysis specialized in Diffusion Model-Based CT Construction & Generation** currently.
I am also an enthusiastic self-learner and interested in various fields of computer science.
